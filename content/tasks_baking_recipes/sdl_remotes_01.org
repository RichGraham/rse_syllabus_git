There are two reasons why you do not only want to have your code in the one ~git~
repository you are working in. One reason to copy it somewhere else is to have a
/backup/ as well as to be able to work on /different computers/ (e.g. using your
code on your laptop as well as on the HPC or a workstation). The other main
reason is /collaboration/.

* Using Local Directories
The first thing we are going to look at is creating a /remote/ on the very same
computer. It sounds a bit odd - but will allow us to play around with remotes
and get used to the concepts without having to set up complicated things on,
e.g. [[https://github.com]].
