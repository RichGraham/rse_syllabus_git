* An Introduction to Remotes
There are two reasons why you do not only want to have your code in the one ~git~
repository you are working in. One reason to copy it somewhere else is to have a
/backup/ as well as to be able to work on /different computers/ (e.g. using your
code on your laptop as well as on the HPC or a workstation). The other main
reason is /collaboration/.
