There are a few requirements. The most important one is, of course, having a ~git~ installation on your computer.

You can get /git/ here: [[https://git-scm.com]].

It mentions several download and install options. For example, if you
are on /Windows/ but cannot install software, you might want to try the portable version here:
https://git-scm.com/download/win (version ~v2.34.1~ at the time of writing).

If you download this and unpack it, then there is a ~PortableGit/git-bash-exe~.
If you start this, it will give you a command line like shown [[fig:git_bash_windows_01][below]] in which you can

In order to be independent from specific UIs or IDEs, we will mainly
focus on the command line here. Usually, the options in UIs and IDEs
are names very similar to the options here.

For computers at the University of Nottingham you can either use the
above portable version of ~git~ or see here:
[[https://workspace.nottingham.ac.uk/display/Software/Git+for+Windows]]

NB: For Computer Science it is available on the remote desktops:
https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient

For a list of possible UIs for git, see:
[[https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows]]

(I personally use [[https://magit.vc]] (runs inside [[https://emacs.org]]).)
