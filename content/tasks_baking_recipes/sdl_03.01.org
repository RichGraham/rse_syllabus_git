* SDL - Creating new Branches
We will mimic different versions of a piece of software by introducing
different versions of recipes: We will create a vegan and a gluten
free version.

We do this by creating new /branches/. In simple terms, a branch is
just a name of a variable which references a point in our repository
history and which allows us to continue development from there.

** Create new branches                                                 :cmds:
To create a new branch at the current state, we can type ~git branch
gluten_free~. This creates a new branch called =gluten_free=
referencing the same point as the current state of the repository.

Now, a call to ~git log~ tells us that there is another branch:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --max-count 2
#+end_src
#+begin_example
7d4a511 (HEAD -> master, gluten_free) add link in cinemon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

The line ~HEAD -> master~ tells us that our current working directory
is still on the old, original branch called =master=.

** Your Task                                                           :task:
