* SDL - A more complicated example and how to abort a merge
Let us re-visit the last example and look at it in more detail.

The main reason for this is to lay a foundation for the
[[file:README.org::*SDL - Merge Conflicts][more complicated merge case later]].

We will learn that /merging/ and /committing/ a merge commit are two
separate steps. The gap between the two allow us to amend necessary
changes.
