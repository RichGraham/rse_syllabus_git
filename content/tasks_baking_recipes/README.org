This folder contains step-by-step examples on how to use git.

In order to keep in language agnostic, we will use baking recipes as
an example. We will create simple text files with recipes and then
modify their content. To mimic more complicated situations, we will
ask you to pretend to be a second person as well.

* Overview

We assume that you have already set-up ~git~ so that you are able to
create new, empty repositories.

The tasks will be all hands-on and you are encouraged to open your
installation of git and type along.

We will view the material presented here from three angles:
- a) :: Why are we doing a special thing?
- b) :: How are we doing it practically?
- c) :: What are some of the technical details behind the scenes?

You can mainly focus on point *b)* if you prefer. Some of you will find
*a)* and *c)* helpful to understand what is going on - everyone's style of
learning is different!

** Learning Outcomes                                                    :LOs:

By the end of these tasks, you will be able to
1. Know how to put files under version control
2. Know the difference between the /index/ and the /repository/
3. Be able to look at the history of a repository
4. ...

** Before you start

   [[file:before_you_start.org][Please follow these steps]] to set up your configuration.

* Tasks

** SDL 01 - Creating a Repository and Adding Content
This self-directed learning task will show you
- how to create a new, empty repository (~git init~)
- how to add files to it (~git add~ and ~git commit~)

1. [[file:sdl_01.01.org][SDL 01.01 - Create a New Repository]]
2. [[file:sdl_01.02.org][SDL 01.02 - Add Some More Files]]

** SDL 02 - Changing Files and Examining the History of Changes
This self-directed learning task will show you
- how to change files and register these changes in the repository
  (~git add~, ~git commit~)
- how to see how the repository is growing as we go along (~git
  status~, ~git diff~, ~git log~, ~git show~)

1. [[file:sdl_02.01.org][SDL 02.01 - Changing existing files]]
2. [[file:sdl_02.02.org][SDL 02.02 - Examining what we have done so far]]
3. [[file:sdl_02.03.org][SDL 02.03 - Examining single commits in more detail and Find Changes]]

** SDL XX - Using Bisection to find Bugs

This is deeply linked to the subjects of having good, automated tests
for your code.

Our recipe example does not really live up to this type of problems
due to its simplicity.
